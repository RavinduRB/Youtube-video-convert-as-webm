### 🚀 Today I created an application together with Chat GPT. A few days ago, the sound equalizer that I had stopped working. I thought of creating a sound equalizer. I created it but faced several problems while implementing it. Therefore, I decided to create an application that converts youtube videos to mp3. In the end, something different was created than what I had set out to create.

### 🚀 Here you can quickly create an mp3 file of any YouTube mp4 video in seconds.
